    ## Find your way with Flutter!

    If you are new to Flutter, and have already worked
    through [your first Flutter codelab](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab),
    this section of the website is for you!

    The goal here is to guide you through some next
    steps of learning Flutter. It's not about teaching
    you how to _program_, it's about teaching you
    how Flutter works.

:::note
These fundamentals docs are still a work
in progress and we welcome your feedback!
Please consider filling out the survey
listed at the bottom of this page and on the
new subject pages in this section.
:::

We suggest that you work through the
following subjects in the listed order.

 1. [Intro to Dart](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/fundamentals/dart) _(Optional)_
    As you might know, Flutter uses the [Dart language](https://dart.dev).
    If you have experience with other object-oriented
    languages, like Java, C++, or Swift,
    Dart should feel familiar to you.
    As of this writing,
    [Dart is one of the fastest-growing languages](https://twitter.com/MiSvTh/status/1732002450641400276?cxt),
    in part, thanks to Flutter.

 2. [Widget fundamentals](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/fundamentals/widgets)
    Learn about one of the primary building blocks
    of a Flutter application, widgets.

 3. [Layout](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/fundamentals/layout)
    Flutter is different from other UI frameworks
    in that you create the layout programmatically.
    This allows you to compose widgets,
    Flutter's basic building blocks,
    to realize your own layout vision.
    It also facilitates designing a UI to
    optimize any screen where your app might be used.

 4. [State management](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/fundamentals/state-management)
    Learn how to share state between widgets and notify other parts of your app
    when the state changes.
    See how to implement MVVM in Flutter to manage state effectively
    for small to medium-sized apps.

 5. [Handling user input](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/fundamentals/user-input)
    Learn about Flutter's widgets that support
    interactivity, like buttons and text.
    Also, learn how to add interactivity to
    a widget that doesn't already support it.

 6. [Networking and data](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/fundamentals/networking)
    Networking is a very large topic,
    so this section focuses on basic networking
    functionality, such as how to retrieve
    or submit data using HTTP,
    how to convert to and from JSON,
    how to use authentication, 
    how to implement asynchronicity, and more.

 7. [Local data and caching](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/fundamentals/local-caching)
    Learn about different techniques for caching
    local data.
